> Traditional ideas from older people about the way to live and behave are not helpful to young people and their futures.\
> To what extent do you agree or disagree?

In the modern-day and age, due to the development of society, eldersâ€™ conservative ideas about life had been devalued drastically. Young minds do not consider such advice, with the majority finding it unhelpful. In this essay, I will examine both points of view and agree with one of them.

The majority of people, who were born since the beginning of the century, tend to have a different perception of the world. This happened because of the societal transformation from postmodernism to metamodernism. While in the 20th-century humans were struggling to find new information or additional sources of it, nowadays, owing to the development of the Internet, it became easier for everyone to source new data. This natural change led to the simplification of opinion-forming, especially among younger generations. Hence traditional ideas from older people about the way to live and behave became both outdated and unneeded by the new society. Another major factor that became into play quite recently is the development of adviser of all sorts.  For example, whereas in the past humans used to consult their friend, family or co-workers nearly on every topic from cats to dishwashing, nowadays it became popular to visit various counsellors, such as psychologist, astrologists and etcetera.

However, not every innovation is perfect. The major downfall of all of the modern technology is the lack of filtering and moderation. As nearly everyone has an access to the Internet today, every person can write their information or even edit the existing one. Firstly, this leads to the oversaturation of data, hence it is nearly impossible to find needed sources. Secondly, a family should understand you better and give more personalized advice for all of your problems.

In conclusion, while with the development of the Internet it is easier to find a solution to nearly every problem, there are several major downsides, where the traditional way has taken advantage. I personally strongly agree, that common knowledge from older people about the way to live and behave are not helpful to young people and their futures.
