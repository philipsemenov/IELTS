>Surveys show that in many countries, people are living longer but increased life expectancy has many implications for the aging individuals and society as a whole. 
>What are the possible effects of longer living for individuals and society?

In recent decades scientist have created amazing technologies in medicine sphere, that manage to treat nearly all known illnesses. Combined with the natural growth in projected length of life, in majority of countries citizens are living longer than ever before. However, this trend has it's own advantages and disadvantages, which I will state in my essay.

The first and the most notable effect that is caused by the increased life expectancy is overpopulation. In recent years several regions, such as China and India, where 56 per cent of population is older than 60 years old, have been suffering from this particular issue, leading to low employment rates and decreased wages. This creates a dangerous political situation, pushing young citizens to leave their countries for the sake of finding a new way to earn money to feed their families. A lot of such job seekers, especially from Africa, proceed to Europe in a refugee status, creating a dangerous geopolitical situation in the particular region. 

However, everything has it's own downsides and upsides. In our case, increased projected length of life can show the current state and overall progress of humanity in such spheres as technology and medicine. If not for them, it is impossible to imagine the latest jump in overall increased living expectancy. Today, depending on resource, an average adult is expected to live from 15 to 20 years more than in 1950. After the World War Two humanity uses it's brightest minds in order to tackle the  problem of making the Earth settelers life better.

In conclusion, while overall increased life expectancy creates several worldwide issues, from overpopulation to the skyrocketed number of refugees, it has it's own advantages as well, one of which is progress in the science field.
