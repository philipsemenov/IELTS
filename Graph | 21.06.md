## Discription
The diagram depicts the production of sugar from sugar canes.
Overall, the process is divided into 5 separate parts and uses two distinct locations, such as field and factory.
There are only two main steps done outside. Growing is the first and the longest stage with duration from 12 to 18 months. When it is compeleted sugar canes are harvested using two drastically diffferent methods. First of them involves using technology, such as tractors and other machines, which increase the speed and the quality of the harvesting process. The second method fully relies on human labour.
After that collected sugar canes are moved to a factory, where the final product is made. First step inside is for sugar canes to be crushed into juice, which is later purified using a limestone filter. Clean substance is than put into an evaporator, where with the use of high temperatures the liquid becomes a syrup. The result is than mixed in a centrifuge used to separate sugar crystals from previously made substance. The last step of the production is to dry and to cool the product for it to become sugar.
