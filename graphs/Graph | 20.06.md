## Description
The pie chart depicts the distribution of online sales in various retail sectors in a country of Canada in both 2005 and 2010.

Overall, the half of sectors improved their numbers in decade, while the other one failed to save and increase the profit.

In 2005 the leading position in this field was held by the sphere of electronics and appliances, where all sales from this sector combined for 35 per cent. However, 10 years later this area lost one twentieth of an overall market. The other sphere, which had its numbers dropped was home furnishing. In a decade the numbers nearly dropped in half from a quarter to 15 per cent in 2005 and 2010 respectively.

On the other side of the spectre is a sector of food in beverages. While in 2005 it was the third largest market loosing to both previously mentioned spheres, in 2010 with a 10 per cent growth from 22 to 32 it became the largest business area in Canada. The other improved sector is video games, which took a 5 per cent leap from 18 to 23.
