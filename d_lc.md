The following diagram depicts all life stages of the honey bee.

Overall, the life cycle of presented spices usually lasts for 7 weeks and involves four main stages.

Life of bees starts when every 72 hours an average female insect lays a couple of eggs. The process of hatching lasts for approximately one and a half weeks, resulting into an emergence of a first form of a bee called nymph. Newborn creatures nearly resemble adult ones and take additional 3 weeks to grow up. In this time period nymphs moult three times on their 5th, 12th and 21st days correspondingly, each time growing in size.
After described processes comes a penultimate step of the development and a young adult emerges. On this point the characteristics of a bee, such as stripes, become visible. In the end it takes averagely four days to fully mature. After that female spices lay eggs and cycle repeats itself.

### Note:
It took me so long for sevelar reasons:
1. I did not use a word counter and wrote a shorter text than needed.
2. I was not sure about how should i interpret the nymph part of the cycle due to poor diagram.
