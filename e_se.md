The void and emptiness of space has always been interesting for humans since the first of us have stepped on the solid ground. Nowadays, many years later, a lot of people assume it is the main priority for humanity to explore new planets and galaxies, however there is a group of people who believes that such interest only wastes essential resources. In this essay I will discuss both sides and give my opinion.

On the one hand, it is extremely important to thing long term due to natural scarcity of resources on the planet Earth. While it may be seem that stocks of  food, some types of energy and even water can be unlimited, it is a costly mistake to make. Most of drinkable solt-free water, for example, is located in the South and North poles in a form of icebergs. However, due to global warming and the resulted melting of the ice structures, scientist project that in approximately eight decades people from all over the world could be left without the main drinking liquid. While this is one aspect of the problem, there is also a more philosophical one. Starting from first scientist and astronomers, humanity was always wondering about the meaning of existence and life in the distant areas of the Milky way and who knows what the search that has been continuing for centuries will lead the Earth inhabitants to. Possibly, new races may be encountered, leading humanities breakthrough.

But not everyone agrees with such opinion. There are a lot of problems that must be tackled in real time. From severe hunger in Africa to pollution all other the world, humanity should open their eyes to a painful reality. Governments and other people in charge ought to understand that it is not always possible to run from problems, especially to other universes. Since an enormous amount of money are being spent on space exploration, leaders should at least consider helping our planet.

While exploring space can help humanity in a long run, short term there are a lot of ways of how it is better to use scarce resources. In my personal opinion, humanity needs to explore space for future generations, however its is important not to forget about present needs.
